./scripts/run_tetris.sh

# Method 3: Alias (after running setup)
tetris
```

### **Running Tests:**
```bash
# Comprehensive test runner
python3 run_tests.py

# Direct pytest
python3 -m pytest tests/

# With alias
tetris-test
```

### **Development Setup:**
```bash
# One-time environment setup
./scripts/setup_environment.sh

# Navigate to project
tetris-dir

# Development workflow ready!
```
